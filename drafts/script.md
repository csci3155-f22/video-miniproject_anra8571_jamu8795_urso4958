- Introductions
- Provide grammars to define the arithmetic expression language
- Explain one-step evaluation
- Explain how one-step evaluation differs from big-step evaluation
- Provide some inference rules to work through a basic arithmetic example (such as simple addition)
    - Explain how each rule is used and how the placement of the substitution affects the order of operations
- Begin our division example
    - We will need two do rules and two search rules
    - Explain how do rules differ from search rules
    - Explain short-circuiting and how the do rules enforce it
    - Explain how the search rules can enforce order of operations
    - Explain how the search rules can enforce associativity
- Explain how to translate the short-circuiting division rules into Scala code
